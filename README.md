## What is Phantom rooms
Phantom rooms is a chat room application that puts your privacy at the center, we don't collect your private data, let alone storing it in a database.
Jump right in anonymously and discuss topics of your interest with the wonderfull people around the world, all without even telling your name.

## How is Phantom rooms different from competition
We put your privacy at the center, and make sure you have the most fun. We don't ask for any private data, and if there is any data to be stored, it will be stored on your device, which will get deleted as soon as you close your tab. Then, it will be like it never happend ! 

## What do I require to chat
A good internet connection, open mind, and some enthusiasm, that's all !

## How to join/create a room
Set your avatar name, and select your tags of interest, we'll show you the rooms based on your interest. Didn't find what you were looking for ? No worries, you can also create a room.

## Anything to keep in mind
Follow Netiquetts, and you are good to go.
